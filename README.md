## Noteify is an artificially intelligent currency detection app made for the visually impaired to check whether they have been handed the right amount of money and thereby, ensuring that they have not been cheated upon, giving the output as a computer-generated audio, having basic UI for better User-Experience. 

This is a project done by me and my partners <a href= "https://github.com/Ashniz24"> Ashna Nizam </a>, <a href= "https://github.com/bensam02"> Ben Sam </a>, <a href= "https://github.com/Mannu7789"> Mannu Thomas </a> and <a href= "https://github.com/PeterChageth"> CJ Peter </a> and the app was developed using the Flutter framework.

The main modules used are:

***camera*** <br>
***tflite*** <br>
***flutter_tts*** <br>
***path_provider***

The backend comprises of the tflite package using a tflite model along with the labels which specifies all the classes. The flutter_tts is a text-to-speech module in flutter used to convert text to speech, used here so that the output can be obtained as an audio.
